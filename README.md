# WebFormDB
A modern web application for managing form entries and database records.

# Project Idea  
This project creates a simple, secure web form that takes a user's name and age, submits it to a PHP server connected to a MySQL database, and displays all stored records on a styled web table. Each record features a toggle button that instantly switches the status between 0 and 1 in the database and reflects the change on the webpage.

# Features  
- Real-time database table with modern UI.  
- Toggle button to instantly switch record status.  
- Clean, modern, and responsive page layout.  
- Code is organized and highly readable.  
- Built with the latest web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, MySQL.

# Project Files
- `Index.html` Welcome page and form page layout with inputs and social icons.
- `Style.css` Complete styling for both form and table pages.
- `Main.js` JavaScript for toggling form visibility and social icon animations.
- `DB.php` PHP file to process form data and insert it into the database.
- `Table.php` PHP file to fetch data and display it in a table with a toggle button.
